## Step 1: Setup the server
- Move to the folder “Server”: cd Server
- Install required packages: npm install
- Start the server: two ways:
     + npm run dev: server will restart whenever the source code in folder "Server" has changed
     + npm start: server will not restart whenever the source code in folder "Server" has changed

- Move to the folder “Booking-app”: cd Booking-app
- Install required packages: npm install or npm install --force
- Start the client: npm start
