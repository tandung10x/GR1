# GR1-2023

Requirements: NodeJS 16.x
 
## Step 1: Setup the server
- Move to the folder “Server”: cd Server
- Install required packages: npm install
- Start the server: two ways:
     + npm run dev: server will restart whenever the source code in folder "Server" has changed
     + npm start: server will not restart whenever the source code in folder "Server" has changed
If the terminal shows “Server is run at port 3000. Connected to mongoDB”, it means that the project’s server is working.
 
## Step 2: Setup the client
- Move to the folder “Booking-app”: cd Booking-app
- Install required packages: npm install or npm install --force
- Start the client: npm start
